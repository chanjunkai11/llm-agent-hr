Discipline must: 1) be progressive 2) consider past practice and equitable treatment, and\\n3) meet the test of just cause.

When documenting each step of progressive discipline, include key\\ninformation about the issue, dates on which issues/incidents occurred, and any corrective\\naction that has been previously taken.\\nd. Implement the discipline promptly. Once an issue has been discovered or an incident has\\noccurred, promptly impl ement any necessary progressive discipline. Be consistent and\\nfair. When deciding on the level of discipline that is appropriate to the issue(s), be\\nconsistent and fair (e.g., implement the same step(s) of progressive discipline for the\\nsame violation). The goal is to guide the employee to correct performance or behavior\\nthe problems, causes and solutions, not to punish the employee.\\ne. Monitor for improvement. Once progressive discipline has been implemented,\\ncontinuously monitor an employee’s performance and/or behavior for improvement.\\nf. Maintain records. Any documentation relating to progressive discipline that has been\\nimplemented should be kept in a confidential location.\\n\\nBENEFITS & LEAVE ADMINISTRATION\\nHealth Benefits Administration (e.g. enrollments, terminations, life events)\\n1.

      "Okay, I'm trying to figure out what the HR assistant should do after an employee files a complaint. The user has given specific steps and documents, but I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the HR assistant needs to address the complaint properly. They have to take immediate action based on the documents provided. Looking at points b, c, d, e, and f, it seems like they should probably place the employee on administrative leave if necessary. That makes sense because it gives time for investigation without interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, reinforce the company's no retaliation policy. I think this means HR should communicate that their policies are in place to prevent retaliation. Maybe by sending out some notices or updating their communication channels. Also, ensuring that disciplinary actions follow this policy is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing an investigator is another step. They need someone experienced and impartial. Maybe the assistant should suggest a specific person who meets these criteria based on the documents provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "For planning the investigation, they have to take some time before starting. This includes monitoring emails, organizing personnel files, and e-mailing HR staff for updates. It's important to ensure that everyone knows what's happening during the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are daily tasks like monitoring emails, filing personnel docs, and e-mailing HR. The assistant should make sure all these happen in order without missing any steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, they need to follow up on the corrective action with employees. They should check back regularly about progress, be alert to retaliation claims, and handle rejections properly. This shows accountability and maintains trust within the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think the assistant should outline each step clearly, use the provided documents as a guide, and ensure that everything is done in a structured way without making any assumptions beyond what's given.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Plan the Investigation**:  \n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Daily Tasks Execution**:  \n",
      "   - Monitor emails diligently, file personnel documents as per the color code system, and e-mail HR staff for updates throughout the investigation period.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Follow Up on Corrective Action**:  \n",
